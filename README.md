# rcl-backend

Prerequisites:

For database i've used mongodb and this repo contains a docker compose which can be used to start a mongodb instance. To start the instance container it's expected to have docker and docker-compose installed in your pc.
If you have separate mongodb server in your local, feel free to apply port number in evars.json if existing connection string won't match


1) Clone the repo

2) Make sure you have running mongodb server

3) npm start
